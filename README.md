Problematic code? Leave it in the branch and direct us there.

Your submission is received on-time via a pull request

###### The submission contains:

###### Your application is deployed to Heroku (optional, but encouraged: with a custom URL)
Cursory use of your app yields no errors that "break" your app
What is on Heroku appears to be identical to what is on Github

##### Presentation

* All group members presented in roughly equal amounts
* The provided structure was followed
* The presentation was interesting, compelling, and enjoyable. That is: the presenters did not simply read off cards or recite memorizations; no presenter monopolized the conversation; the presenters seemed genuine; the content was informative
